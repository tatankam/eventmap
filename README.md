# ReMap üó∫Ô∏èüîç


ReMap (Route Event Map) is a powerful platform that helps users discover relevant events along custom travel routes by combining semantic similarity search with dynamic geospatial and temporal filtering. Events are visualized on an interactive map powered by OpenStreetMap, providing a rich and seamless user experience.

Currently, ReMap uses synthetically generated event data for demonstration and testing purposes. Developing a dedicated platform for ingesting, managing, and utilizing real-world event data is planned as a crucial next step to expand the platform‚Äôs practical usage and customization.

## Features

- Store detailed event metadata including title, description, venue, address, latitude, and longitude.
- Perform advanced semantic search using sparse and dense embeddings of event descriptions stored in the powerful Qdrant vector database.
- Combine search with robust geospatial filtering within buffer zones along routes and temporal filtering by travel windows.
- Support multiple transport profiles (driving, cycling, walking) with routing via OpenRouteService API.
- Limit the number of returned events for tailored results.
- Interactive frontend built with Streamlit and OpenStreetMap for route visualization, buffered search areas, event markers, and detailed information panels.
- Input validation to ensure consistent date/time windows and query parameters.

## Technology Highlights

At the core of ReMap is **Qdrant**, a cutting-edge vector database designed for scalable, high-performance similarity search with integrated geospatial and temporal payload filtering. Leveraging Qdrant‚Äôs hybrid search capabilities, ReMap indexes both sparse and dense embeddings to provide accurate, context-aware event recommendations aligned with user travel routes.

To enhance user experience and input flexibility, ReMap employs **CrewAI** combined with the **Mistral large language model (LLM)** for sophisticated natural language understanding. This setup enables users to describe their travel plans and search queries naturally, which are then precisely parsed into structured query parameters executed efficiently by the backend. This natural language integration bridges the gap between human intent and technical search operations, making ReMap intuitive and powerful.

## How It Works

1. User provides origin, destination, travel buffer, transport mode, text query, travel time window, and number of desired event results.
2. Backend generates an optimized travel route and constructs a buffered polygon around it.
3. Qdrant executes a hybrid semantic similarity search combined with geo-filtering and temporal constraints.
4. Frontend displays the route, buffered search area, and relevant events interactively on an OpenStreetMap base.
5. Event details are accessible through map popups and a detailed event list.
6. Invalid input cases are gracefully handled and communicated.
